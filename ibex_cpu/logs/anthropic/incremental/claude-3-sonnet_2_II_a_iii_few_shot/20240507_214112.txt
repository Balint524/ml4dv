Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered

- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered

- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x515033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- add_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation add with same source registers.
- sub_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sub with same source registers.
- sll_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as one of the source registers.
- srl_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation srl with register zero as one of the source registers.
- jal->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x10623. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sub_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sub with same source registers.
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- slt->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered

You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sub_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sub with same source registers.
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- sll->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- or->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x10637. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sub_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sub with same source registers.
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- sra->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb1a633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sub_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sub with same source registers.
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- jal->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xd1e7b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x718213. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sub_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sub with same source registers.
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- slt->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x40a185b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sub_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sub with same source registers.
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- sra->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation srl with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sltu_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sltu with same source registers.
- and->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb6b7b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sub_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sub with same source registers.
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- add->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sltu with register zero as the destination register.
- or->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x958633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sub_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sub with same source registers.
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- slt->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb1b333. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- sll_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sll->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sltu with register zero as one of the source registers.
- srl_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation srl with register zero as one of the source registers.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x10e3f. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xc12633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- sll_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as one of the source registers.
- add->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xc7c633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x537. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- sll_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as one of the source registers.
- or->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sub->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb127b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- sll_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- or->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x800000ef. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sltu_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sltu with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sltu->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- srl_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation srl with register zero as one of the source registers.
- jal->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xc3d833. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- jal->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x92d633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- xor->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb1a033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- slt->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x51c233. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sll->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb1e633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- jal->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb22a33. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xe15633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sll->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x40a702b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sub->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x718833. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sltu->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xc7c633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sll->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

Content: Thanks for your response.
The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb1e7b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sub->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered

------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x80000eef. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- and->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa1a633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb7a023. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- xor->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xffdff06f. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x51c23b. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- add->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x501023. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- xor->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

Content: Thanks for your response.
The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb5d7b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sll->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered

------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xe12023. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x718b33. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x40d700b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- jal->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: Thanks for your response.
The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb1e7b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sra->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation and with register zero as one of the source registers.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered

- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb1cb33. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sra->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb18c33. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sub->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xe7e633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sltu->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb5c7b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sra->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x1f800ef. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xe7e6b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sub->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x6080ef. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sra->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x51a823. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- and->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

Content: Thanks for your response.
The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xc0006f. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sra->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x518633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sra->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x318293. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sll->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xf7a2a3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xd3c233. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- slt->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x51c333. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- xor->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sll->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: Thanks for your response.
The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x40b00033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- and->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered

- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xd10aa3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sltu->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa12023. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x00718a33 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00111 rs1=00011 funct3=000 rd=10100 op=0110011 => add_seen covered
- 0xffdff06f => imm=-4 rd=00000 op=1101111 => jal_seen, jal_br_backwards, jal_zero_dst covered
- 0x000292b3 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00000 rs1=00101 funct3=001 rd=00101 op=0110011 => sll_seen, sll_zero_src covered
- 0x00f7a2a3 => imm=5 rs2=01111 rs1=01111 funct3=010 op=0100011 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0x00101023 => imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00000 funct3=001 op=0100011 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x020b1b3, 0x0051c233 => funct7=0000000 rs2=00010 rs1=00001 funct3=011 rd=00011 op=0110011, funct7=0000000 rs2=00101 rs1=00011 funct3=100 rd=00100 op=0110011 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered
- 0x006080ef, 0x00112023 => imm=32774 rd=00001 op=1101111, imm=0 rs2=00001 rs1=00010 funct3=010 op=0100011 => jal_seen, jal_br_forwards, sw_seen, jal->sw_raw_hazard covered
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

Content: Thanks for your response.
The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xf74f33. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb82633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
