Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x1000133. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sra->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x100013. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- slt_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation slt with register zero as the destination register.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x537. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- slt_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation slt with register zero as one of the source registers.
- srl->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x513. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x512023. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- slt_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation slt with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sra_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with register zero as the destination register.
- sll->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x1513. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x18033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- slt_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation slt with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sll->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa11333. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- or->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x13006b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- and_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation and with same source registers.
- sra->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x13. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- srl_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation srl with register zero as the destination register.
- add->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with register zero as the destination register.
- or->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa00033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x712023. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- xor->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sw_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sw with register zero as one of the source registers.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x858833. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- or->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation srl with register zero as the destination register.
- xor->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x40a05537. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- jal->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x18033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- jal->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x151513. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- sra->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x303b7. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- xor->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation srl with same source registers.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x18133. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- or->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation and with register zero as the destination register.
- sra->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa00033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- srl->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa0a023. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_zero_dst: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with register zero as the destination register.
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- xor->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x270033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x707033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- add->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x505533. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sra->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sw_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sw with register zero as one of the source registers.
- or->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x707733. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- sll->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x1d93. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x318833. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- sub->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x757733. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- xor_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation xor with same source registers.
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- xor->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa6c833. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- jal->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- add->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa305b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- sh_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sh with register zero as one of the source registers.
- sll->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x40a585b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- and->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file

---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x303b03b. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- jal->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sh_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sh with same source registers.
- or->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb00033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- or->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x317213. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb586b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- or->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x413837. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- or->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sh_zero_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sh with register zero as one of the source registers.
- or->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa0a7b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- jal->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x757733. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- sra->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x6081b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- srl->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation and with same source registers.
- add->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x300093. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x118c3b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- sra->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x707733. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- or->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sb_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sb operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb1b0b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb0b7b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb582b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- and_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation and with same source registers.
- and->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- and->xor_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a xor operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x966633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- jal->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
------
Please generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff), with output format: [a, b, c, ...]. Make sure the instructions are valid RISC-V instruction codes.Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x21c833. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- or->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x40b00533. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- sra->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sltu->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sltu operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa586b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xa29033. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- and->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sltu_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sltu operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb58633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- add->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a add operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- and->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->sw_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sw operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

Content: We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as "zero", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xf787b3. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- and_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation and with same source registers.
- or->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- jal->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a jal operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0x40a78633. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- xor->sra_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sra operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sub->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sub operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was 0xb57733. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of address-instruction pairs to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sra_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sra with same source registers.
- or_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation or with same source registers.
- and->slt_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a and operation followed by a slt operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- or->add_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a or operation followed by a add operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- xor->sh_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a xor operation followed by a sh operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sra->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sra operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
