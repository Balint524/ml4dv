1,1,1,1778,"""We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

8,2,1,1778,"""We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0

    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

24,4,1,1778,"""We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):

    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

40,6,1,1778,"""We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0

    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.

54,8,1,1778,"""We are working with a CPU capable of executing RISC-V instructions. Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- There are 14 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [funct7 (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0000000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 000, funct7: 0100000): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 111, funct7: 0000000): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 110, funct7: 0000000): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 100, funct7: 0000000): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 001, funct7: 0000000): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0000000): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 101, funct7: 0100000): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 010, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 0110011, funct3: 011, funct7: 0000000): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - S-type (format: [imm[11:5] (7 bits)][rs2 (5 bits)][rs1 (5 bits)][funct3 (3 bits)][imm[4:0] (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 010): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 0100011, funct3: 000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] (20 bits)][rd (5 bits)][op (7 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 1101111): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or S-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or S-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.
------
Following the bins description, generate a list, which can be empty if necessary, of ainstructions in 32-bit hexadecimal format to update the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the specified bins upon resuming execution from the current PC. Make sure the instructions are VALID R-type, S-type, or J-type instructions. We encourage you to use a diverse variety of operations.
