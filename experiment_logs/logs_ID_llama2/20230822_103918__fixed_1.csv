------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.
