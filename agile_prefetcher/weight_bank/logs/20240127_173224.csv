1,1,1,590,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a weight bank.The purpose of this device is to load data (weights) from RAM into a FIFO, then output them diagonally.Then, you are going to generate a list of integer pairs to cover these test cases.

----------
Now, we want to test the weight bank with a list of integer pairs as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide pairs of integers.
- The output of the DUT is the contents of it's FIFO, which is sent diagonally (i.e. one unit of data is sent from the first row, then from both the first and second, then first, second and third etc.).
- The actual data content of the FIFO is not important. Instead, we are interested in the ""dimensions"" of the output (what is the maximum number of rows accessed simultaneously, and how many units of data are sent from each row).
- The first integer in the integer pairs you send defines how many units of data is loaded on each row, and the second defines how many rows of the FIFO are loaded with valid data.
- For each of the following bins, you need to provide at least one integer pair that satisfies it (i can take a value from 1 to 64, j from 1 to 4):
---
    - out_i - i number of rows were loaded with valid data, hence i is the maximum number of rows accessed simultaneously
    - in_j - j*16 units of data is loaded on each row - due to how the device works, only multiples of 16 can be loaded on each row. If you provide a number that is not divisible by 16, it will be rounded up inside the hardware.
    - combined_features_i_j - i number of rows were loaded with valid data, and j*16 units of data is loaded on each row

Following the bins description, generate a list of integer pairs which covers the described bins as much as you can.
