1,1,1,2072,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

26,2,1,1996,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

50,3,1,2112,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

63,4,1,1906,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

- 0xa4010000 => op=101001 rs=00000 rt=00001 imm=0000000000000000 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x0022182b, 0x00652026 => op=000000 rs=00001 rt=00010 rd=00011 sa=00000 funct=101011, op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00101 rd=00100 sa=00000 funct=100110 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered

70,5,1,1841,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered
- 0x0c00000a => op=000011 instr_index=00000000000000000000001010 => jal_seen covered

- 0x00f7a2a3 => op=101011 rs=01111 rt=01111 imm=0000000000000101 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0xa4010000 => op=101001 rs=00000 rt=00001 imm=0000000000000000 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x0022182b, 0x00652026 => op=000000 rs=00001 rt=00010 rd=00011 sa=00000 funct=101011, op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00101 rd=00100 sa=00000 funct=100110 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered

77,6,1,1974,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

85,7,1,2034,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

105,9,1,1872,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

112,10,1,1813,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

- 0xa4010000 => op=101001 rs=00000 rt=00001 imm=0000000000000000 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x0022182b, 0x00652026 => op=000000 rs=00001 rt=00010 rd=00011 sa=00000 funct=101011, op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00101 rd=00100 sa=00000 funct=100110 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered

119,11,1,2208,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

------
Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

- 0xa4010000 => op=101001 rs=00000 rt=00001 imm=0000000000000000 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x0022182b, 0x00652026 => op=000000 rs=00001 rt=00010 rd=00011 sa=00000 funct=101011, op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00101 rd=00100 sa=00000 funct=100110 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

133,13,1,2117,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

147,15,1,1873,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

161,17,1,1920,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

- 0xa4010000 => op=101001 rs=00000 rt=00001 imm=0000000000000000 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x0022182b, 0x00652026 => op=000000 rs=00001 rt=00010 rd=00011 sa=00000 funct=101011, op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00101 rd=00100 sa=00000 funct=100110 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

175,19,1,1918,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

189,21,1,2221,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

- 0xa4010000 => op=101001 rs=00000 rt=00001 imm=0000000000000000 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x0022182b, 0x00652026 => op=000000 rs=00001 rt=00010 rd=00011 sa=00000 funct=101011, op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00101 rd=00100 sa=00000 funct=100110 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered

DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

203,23,1,1830,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

224,26,1,1993,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

232,27,1,2226,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

- 0xa4010000 => op=101001 rs=00000 rt=00001 imm=0000000000000000 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x0022182b, 0x00652026 => op=000000 rs=00001 rt=00010 rd=00011 sa=00000 funct=101011, op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00101 rd=00100 sa=00000 funct=100110 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

256,30,1,1811,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

277,33,1,1966,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

Here are a few examples:
- 0x0067a020 => op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00111 rd=10100 sa=00000 funct=100000 => add_seen covered

- 0x00f7a2a3 => op=101011 rs=01111 rt=01111 imm=0000000000000101 => sw_seen, sw_same_src covered
- 0xa4010000 => op=101001 rs=00000 rt=00001 imm=0000000000000000 => sh_seen, sh_zero_src covered
- 0x0022182b, 0x00652026 => op=000000 rs=00001 rt=00010 rd=00011 sa=00000 funct=101011, op=000000 rs=00011 rt=00101 rd=00100 sa=00000 funct=100110 => sltu_seen, xor_seen, sltu->xor_raw_hazard covered

291,35,1,1969,"""You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a MIPS CPU. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff to update the instruction memory in order to cover these test cases, where the integer represents a MIPS instruction, next loaded into instruction memory. DO NOT SUPPLY 0x0 AS AN INSTRUCTION

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):
---
OPERATIONS
  - R-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][rd (5 bits)][sa (5 bits)][function (6 bits)]):
    - ADD (opcode: 000000, function: 100000): addition between two register files
    - SUB (opcode: 000000, function: 100010): subtraction between two register files
    - AND (opcode: 000000, function: 100100): logical operation AND between two register files
    - OR (opcode: 000000, function: 100101): logical operation OR between two register files
    - XOR (opcode: 000000, function: 100110): logical operation XOR between two register files
    - SLL (opcode: 000000, function: 001111): logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRL (opcode: 000000, function: 000010): logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRA (opcode: 000000, function: 000011): arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLT (opcode: 000000, function: 101010): make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU (opcode: 000000, function: 101011): make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
  - I-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][rs (5 bits)][rt (5 bits)][immediate (16 bits)]):
    - SW (opcode: 101011): store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH (opcode: 101001): store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB (opcode: 101000): load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to the data memory at the address equal to a register file
  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

----------
We are working with a CPU capable of executing MIPS instructions. Remember that one instruction is 32 bits (8 bytes).
Our objective is to update the CPU's instruction memory with a sequence of 32-bit addresses and corresponding 32-bit instructions. The goal is to ensure that, when the CPU resumes executing instructions from the current PC, it covers the bins (i.e. test cases) that are of interest to us. 
Here's the description of the bins that are of interest to us:

BINS DESCRIPTION
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- Register 0 is denoted as ""zero"", and its content is always 0.
- DO NOT SUPPLY 0x00000000 AS THE INSTRUCTION!
- There are 14 available types of operations (ONLY USE THESE!):

  - J-type (format: [opcode (6 bits)][instr_index (26 bits)]):
    - JAL (opcode: 000011): store the address of next instruction as the return address in a register file, then jump (increase PC) by an immediate (i.e. constant value)
---

- BIN type 1: Make the CPU perform each operation at least once.
- BIN type 2: For each R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as the destination register (rd).
- BIN type 3: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction with register zero as one of the source registers (rs).
- BIN type 4: For each R-type or I-type operation, make the CPU execute an instruction where both source registers are the same register file.
- BIN type 5: For the JAL operation, make the CPU execute both forward jumps and backward jumps.

- Read-after-Write (RaW) hazard: happens when the current instruction reads from a register which the previous instruction wrote to.
- BIN type 6: For each R-type or I-type operation following an R-type or J-type operation, make the CPU execute two instructions that would cause an RaW hazard.

The CPU has successfully executed numerous instructions following your update. The last instruction performed was None. 
You will now observe the bins haven't been achieved by the CPU, and proceed to generate another list, which can be empty if necessary, of instructions to further modify the CPU's memory, ensuring it covers the previously unreached bins (i.e. test cases) upon resuming execution from the current PC.
Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- sll_same_src: the CPU hasn't executed an instruction that performs the operation sll with same source registers.
- sll->sub_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a sub operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->and_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a and operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- sll->srl_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a sll operation followed by a srl operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- srl->or_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a srl operation followed by a or operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
- slt->sll_raw_hazard: the CPU hasn't perform a slt operation followed by a sll operation with RaW hazard, in which the second operation has a source register that is the same as the destination register of the first operation.
