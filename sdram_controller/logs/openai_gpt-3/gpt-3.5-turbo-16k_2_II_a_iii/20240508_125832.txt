Content: You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT).
----------
Now, we want to test the DUT with a list of commands as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]
- The DUT is an SDRAM controller (without burst support)
- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:
    - First integer: write enable.
    - Second integer: read enable.
    - Third integer: reset. It is not advised to reset the design regularly.
- At least one clock cycle will pass between writing the inner lists on the inputs.
- Other inputs, such as address and data are not important, you will not provide these.
- The coverage bins are the possible commands the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM. You need to cover each of the following bins with your commands:
---
    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
    - command_inhibit: command inhibit (no operation)
    - load_mode_register: configure the DRAM chip
    - activate: open a row for read and write commands
    - read: read data from the currently active row
    - write: write data to the currently active row
---
------

----------
Following the bins description, generate a list of integer pairs which covers the described bins as much as you can.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]

- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:

    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.

Content: You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT).
----------
Now, we want to test the DUT with a list of commands as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]
- The DUT is an SDRAM controller (without burst support)
- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:
    - First integer: write enable.
    - Second integer: read enable.
    - Third integer: reset. It is not advised to reset the design regularly.
- At least one clock cycle will pass between writing the inner lists on the inputs.
- Other inputs, such as address and data are not important, you will not provide these.
- The coverage bins are the possible commands the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM. You need to cover each of the following bins with your commands:
---
    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
    - command_inhibit: command inhibit (no operation)
    - load_mode_register: configure the DRAM chip
    - activate: open a row for read and write commands
    - read: read data from the currently active row
    - write: write data to the currently active row
---
------

----------
Following the bins description, generate a list of integer pairs which covers the described bins as much as you can.
