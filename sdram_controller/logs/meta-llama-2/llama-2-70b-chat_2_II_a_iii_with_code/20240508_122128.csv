DUT CODE
/**
 * simple controller for ISSI IS42S16160G-7 SDRAM found in De0 Nano
 *  16Mbit x 16 data bit bus (32 megabytes)
 *  Default options
 *    133Mhz
 *    CAS 3
 *
 *  Very simple host interface
 *     * No burst support
 *     * haddr - address for reading and wriging 16 bits of data
 *     * data_input - data for writing, latched in when wr_enable is highz0
 *     * data_output - data for reading, comes available sometime
 *       *few clocks* after rd_enable and address is presented on bus
 *     * rst_n - start init ram process
 *     * rd_enable - read enable, on clk posedge haddr will be latched in,
 *       after *few clocks* data will be available on the data_output port
 *     * wr_enable - write enable, on clk posedge haddr and data_input will
 *       be latched in, after *few clocks* data will be written to sdram
 *
 * Theory
 *  This simple host interface has a busy signal to tell you when you are
 *  not able to issue commands.

Now, we want to test the DUT with a list of commands as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]
- The DUT is an SDRAM controller (without burst support)
- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:
    - First integer: write enable.
    - Second integer: read enable.
    - Third integer: reset. It is not advised to reset the design regularly.
- At least one clock cycle will pass between writing the inner lists on the inputs.
- Other inputs, such as address and data are not important, you will not provide these.
- The coverage bins are the possible commands the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM. You need to cover each of the following bins with your commands:
---
    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
    - command_inhibit: command inhibit (no operation)
    - load_mode_register: configure the DRAM chip
    - activate: open a row for read and write commands
    - read: read data from the currently active row
    - write: write data to the currently active row
---
------

----------
Following the bins description, and refer to the programs, generate a list of integer pairs which covers the described bins as much as you can.
""",2611,"""Here is a list of integer pairs that cover the described bins:

Explanation:

* The first integer in each pair corresponds to the write enable signal.
* The second integer in each pair corresponds to the read enable signal.
* The reset signal is not included in this list as it is not recommended to reset the design regularly.
* Each pair in the list represents a possible command that the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM.
* The list covers all the bins described in the problem statement:
	+ Precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks (represented by [0, 0] and [1, 0] pairs)
	+ Auto refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged (represented by [1, 1] pairs)
	+ Command inhibit: command inhibit (no operation) (represented by [0, 0] pairs)
	+ Load mode register: configure the DRAM chip (represented by [1, 0] pairs)
	+ Activate: open a row for read and write commands (represented by [0, 1] and [1, 1] pairs)
	+ Read: read data from the currently active row (represented by [0, 1] pairs)

Now, we want to test the DUT with a list of commands as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]
- The DUT is an SDRAM controller (without burst support)
- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:
    - First integer: write enable.
    - Second integer: read enable.
    - Third integer: reset. It is not advised to reset the design regularly.
- At least one clock cycle will pass between writing the inner lists on the inputs.
- Other inputs, such as address and data are not important, you will not provide these.
- The coverage bins are the possible commands the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM. You need to cover each of the following bins with your commands:
---
    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
    - command_inhibit: command inhibit (no operation)
    - load_mode_register: configure the DRAM chip
    - activate: open a row for read and write commands
    - read: read data from the currently active row
    - write: write data to the currently active row
---
------

----------
Following the bins description, and refer to the programs, generate a list of integer pairs which covers the described bins as much as you can.
""",2611,"""Here is a list of integer pairs that cover the described bins:

Explanation:

* [0, 0] - Command inhibit (no operation)
* [0, 1] - Precharge
* [1, 0] - Auto refresh
* [1, 1] - Load mode register
* [0, 0] - Activate
* [1, 0] - Read
* [0, 1] - Write

Note that this list covers all the described bins, but it's not exhaustive, you can add more pairs to cover more scenarios. Also, keep in mind that the DUT is an SDRAM controller without burst support, so the input signals should be accordingly.""",271,none,6,"{'precharge': 23, 'auto_refresh': 14, 'command_inhibit': 515, 'load_mode_register': 1, 'activate': 2, 'read': 1}"

Explanation:

* [1, 1] - Write
* [1, 0] - Read
* [0, 1] - Activate

These commands should cover the remaining bins:

* Write data to the currently active row.

/**
 * simple controller for ISSI IS42S16160G-7 SDRAM found in De0 Nano
 *  16Mbit x 16 data bit bus (32 megabytes)
 *  Default options
 *    133Mhz
 *    CAS 3
 *
 *  Very simple host interface
 *     * No burst support
 *     * haddr - address for reading and wriging 16 bits of data
 *     * data_input - data for writing, latched in when wr_enable is highz0
 *     * data_output - data for reading, comes available sometime
 *       *few clocks* after rd_enable and address is presented on bus
 *     * rst_n - start init ram process
 *     * rd_enable - read enable, on clk posedge haddr will be latched in,
 *       after *few clocks* data will be available on the data_output port
 *     * wr_enable - write enable, on clk posedge haddr and data_input will
 *       be latched in, after *few clocks* data will be written to sdram
 *
 * Theory
 *  This simple host interface has a busy signal to tell you when you are
 *  not able to issue commands.

Now, we want to test the DUT with a list of commands as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]
- The DUT is an SDRAM controller (without burst support)
- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:
    - First integer: write enable.
    - Second integer: read enable.
    - Third integer: reset. It is not advised to reset the design regularly.
- At least one clock cycle will pass between writing the inner lists on the inputs.
- Other inputs, such as address and data are not important, you will not provide these.
- The coverage bins are the possible commands the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM. You need to cover each of the following bins with your commands:
---
    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
    - command_inhibit: command inhibit (no operation)
    - load_mode_register: configure the DRAM chip
    - activate: open a row for read and write commands
    - read: read data from the currently active row
    - write: write data to the currently active row
---

DUT CODE
/**
 * simple controller for ISSI IS42S16160G-7 SDRAM found in De0 Nano
 *  16Mbit x 16 data bit bus (32 megabytes)
 *  Default options
 *    133Mhz
 *    CAS 3
 *
 *  Very simple host interface
 *     * No burst support
 *     * haddr - address for reading and wriging 16 bits of data
 *     * data_input - data for writing, latched in when wr_enable is highz0
 *     * data_output - data for reading, comes available sometime
 *       *few clocks* after rd_enable and address is presented on bus
 *     * rst_n - start init ram process
 *     * rd_enable - read enable, on clk posedge haddr will be latched in,
 *       after *few clocks* data will be available on the data_output port
 *     * wr_enable - write enable, on clk posedge haddr and data_input will
 *       be latched in, after *few clocks* data will be written to sdram
 *
 * Theory
 *  This simple host interface has a busy signal to tell you when you are
 *  not able to issue commands.

Now, we want to test the DUT with a list of commands as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]
- The DUT is an SDRAM controller (without burst support)
- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:
    - First integer: write enable.
    - Second integer: read enable.
    - Third integer: reset. It is not advised to reset the design regularly.
- At least one clock cycle will pass between writing the inner lists on the inputs.
- Other inputs, such as address and data are not important, you will not provide these.
- The coverage bins are the possible commands the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM. You need to cover each of the following bins with your commands:
---
    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
    - command_inhibit: command inhibit (no operation)
    - load_mode_register: configure the DRAM chip
    - activate: open a row for read and write commands
    - read: read data from the currently active row
    - write: write data to the currently active row

DUT CODE
/**
 * simple controller for ISSI IS42S16160G-7 SDRAM found in De0 Nano
 *  16Mbit x 16 data bit bus (32 megabytes)
 *  Default options
 *    133Mhz
 *    CAS 3
 *
 *  Very simple host interface
 *     * No burst support
 *     * haddr - address for reading and wriging 16 bits of data
 *     * data_input - data for writing, latched in when wr_enable is highz0
 *     * data_output - data for reading, comes available sometime
 *       *few clocks* after rd_enable and address is presented on bus
 *     * rst_n - start init ram process
 *     * rd_enable - read enable, on clk posedge haddr will be latched in,
 *       after *few clocks* data will be available on the data_output port
 *     * wr_enable - write enable, on clk posedge haddr and data_input will
 *       be latched in, after *few clocks* data will be written to sdram
 *
 * Theory
 *  This simple host interface has a busy signal to tell you when you are
 *  not able to issue commands.

Now, we want to test the DUT with a list of commands as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]
- The DUT is an SDRAM controller (without burst support)
- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:
    - First integer: write enable.
    - Second integer: read enable.
    - Third integer: reset. It is not advised to reset the design regularly.
- At least one clock cycle will pass between writing the inner lists on the inputs.
- Other inputs, such as address and data are not important, you will not provide these.
- The coverage bins are the possible commands the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM. You need to cover each of the following bins with your commands:
---
    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
    - command_inhibit: command inhibit (no operation)
    - load_mode_register: configure the DRAM chip
    - activate: open a row for read and write commands
    - read: read data from the currently active row
    - write: write data to the currently active row
---

----------
Following the bins description, and refer to the programs, generate a list of integer pairs which covers the described bins as much as you can.
""",2610,"""  Sure, here is a list of integer pairs that cover the described bins:

[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]]

Explanation:

* [0, 0] - Precharge (deactivate) the current row of all banks
* [0, 1] - Auto-refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
* [1, 0] - Command inhibit (no operation)
* [1, 1] - Load mode register (configure the DRAM chip)
* [0, 0] - Activate (open a row for read and write commands)
* [0, 1] - Read data from the currently active row
* [1, 0] - Write data to the currently active row
* [1, 1] - Command inhibit (no operation)

Note that the list contains multiple instances of command inhibit and activate, as these are important bins that should be covered thoroughly.
