DUT CODE
/**
 * simple controller for ISSI IS42S16160G-7 SDRAM found in De0 Nano
 *  16Mbit x 16 data bit bus (32 megabytes)
 *  Default options
 *    133Mhz
 *    CAS 3
 *
 *  Very simple host interface
 *     * No burst support
 *     * haddr - address for reading and wriging 16 bits of data
 *     * data_input - data for writing, latched in when wr_enable is highz0
 *     * data_output - data for reading, comes available sometime
 *       *few clocks* after rd_enable and address is presented on bus
 *     * rst_n - start init ram process
 *     * rd_enable - read enable, on clk posedge haddr will be latched in,
 *       after *few clocks* data will be available on the data_output port
 *     * wr_enable - write enable, on clk posedge haddr and data_input will
 *       be latched in, after *few clocks* data will be written to sdram
 *
 * Theory
 *  This simple host interface has a busy signal to tell you when you are
 *  not able to issue commands.

Now, we want to test the DUT with a list of commands as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]
- The DUT is an SDRAM controller (without burst support)
- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:
    - First integer: write enable.
    - Second integer: read enable.
    - Third integer: reset. It is not advised to reset the design regularly.
- At least one clock cycle will pass between writing the inner lists on the inputs.
- Other inputs, such as address and data are not important, you will not provide these.
- The coverage bins are the possible commands the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM. You need to cover each of the following bins with your commands:
---
    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
    - command_inhibit: command inhibit (no operation)
    - load_mode_register: configure the DRAM chip
    - activate: open a row for read and write commands
    - read: read data from the currently active row
    - write: write data to the currently active row
---
------

----------
Following the bins description, and refer to the programs, generate a list of integer pairs which covers the described bins as much as you can.
""",936,"""

```

Explanation:

* [0, 0, 0] - precharge (row close)
* [0, 0, 1] - auto_refresh (refresh one row of each bank)
* [0, 1, 0] - command_inhibit (no operation)
* [0, 1, 1] - load_mode_register (configure the DRAM chip)
* [1, 0, 0] - activate (open a row for read and write commands)
* [1, 0, 1] - read (read data from the currently active row)

Now, we want to test the DUT with a list of commands as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- You provide a list of lists, in the format: [[int, int, int], [int, int, int], ...]
- The DUT is an SDRAM controller (without burst support)
- The two integers in each list correspond to two input signal to the SDRAM controller:
    - First integer: write enable.
    - Second integer: read enable.
    - Third integer: reset. It is not advised to reset the design regularly.
- At least one clock cycle will pass between writing the inner lists on the inputs.
- Other inputs, such as address and data are not important, you will not provide these.
- The coverage bins are the possible commands the SDRAM controller can generate for the SDRAM. You need to cover each of the following bins with your commands:
---
    - precharge: deactivate (close) the current row of all banks
    - auto_refresh: refresh one row of each bank, using an internal counter. All banks must be precharged.
    - command_inhibit: command inhibit (no operation)
    - load_mode_register: configure the DRAM chip
    - activate: open a row for read and write commands
    - read: read data from the currently active row
    - write: write data to the currently active row
---
------

Following the bins description, and refer to the programs, generate a list of integer pairs which covers the described bins as much as you can.
